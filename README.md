# CLI Proxy API -- Antigravity self proxy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Features & Fixes

- **Cloned from:** [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/...)
- **New Config Option:** `antigravity-proxy`

**Reasoning:**
The initial login (`-antigravity-login`) creates a session JSON file. When running with a config file later, the system auto-loads this session. However, the global `proxy-url` applies to all APIs indiscriminately. 

In a multi-model setup (e.g., using both **Antigravity** and **Qwen3-coder-plus**), this "one-size-fits-all" proxy approach is incorrect—Antigravity may need a proxy while Qwen3 does not. Since process-level proxies (like Proxifier) cannot split traffic by provider, I implemented a dedicated `antigravity-proxy` option to allow granular routing.

English | [中文](README_CN.md)

A proxy server that provides OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Codex compatible API interfaces for CLI.

It now also supports OpenAI Codex (GPT models) and Claude Code via OAuth.

So you can use local or multi-account CLI access with OpenAI(include Responses)/Gemini/Claude-compatible clients and SDKs.

## Management API

see [MANAGEMENT_API.md](https://help.router-for.me/management/api)

## Amp CLI Support

CLIProxyAPI includes integrated support for [Amp CLI](https://ampcode.com) and Amp IDE extensions, enabling you to use your Google/ChatGPT/Claude OAuth subscriptions with Amp's coding tools:

- Provider route aliases for Amp's API patterns (`/api/provider/{provider}/v1...`)
- Management proxy for OAuth authentication and account features
- Smart model fallback with automatic routing
- **Model mapping** to route unavailable models to alternatives (e.g., `claude-opus-4.5` → `claude-sonnet-4`)
- Security-first design with localhost-only management endpoints
